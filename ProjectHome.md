soak is a tiny library which lets developer access SpiderOak cluster directly from Java code.

Check [Overview](Overview.md) to see how to use it.

I'm not affiliated in any way with SpiderOak. If you stumble upon any errors when using this library, please drop me a line. All issues are certainly due to bugs in soak, and are not caused by SpiderOak servers or Web API, which are certainly rock-solid.
